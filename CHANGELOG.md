notes:
- __Vue 2.7 bug__  
There is currently a bug in Vue 2.7.x that prevents a "dragend" event from firing after a successful "drop".

research:
- look into parallax scrolling features
- look into adding web3 wallet features
- is it possible to make the library CSS tool (CSS-in-JS) agnostic?

bugs:

tasks:
- finish up work on form controls
- write tests for all utils & loaders
- investigate context disconnections from descendant side
- add examples for components missing them
- allow for free floating drag-and-drop
