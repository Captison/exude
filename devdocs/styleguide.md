# Styleguide

The component style guide is generated by `vue-styleguidist`.  All configuration and markdown files are at __/guide__.  

The styleguide is configured to look for a component's example file under __/guide/components__ following the same path the component is found under __/source/components__.  I.e., the example file for component __/source/components/example/Example.vue__ must be __/guide/components/example/Example.md__.

Additional styleguide doc files are at __/guide/content__, and styleguidist configuration is at __/guide/config__.  Note that the __/guide/config/updateDocs.js___ file injects some customization to add informative labels to components as well as (try to) fix some problematic markdown rendering.

Please see the `vue-styleguidist` [documentation](https://vue-styleguidist.github.io) for more details on how to configure and manage the styleguide.
