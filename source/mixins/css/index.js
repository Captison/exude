    CSS Generation Mixins.
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These mixins are used with `styler` mixin to generate dynamic CSS for 
    components. Property names defined across these mixins must be unique.
    
    Some mixins will respond to `inactive` state being set on the component.
